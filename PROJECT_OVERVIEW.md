DeepFlightAI :
Predicting aircraft failures and accidents using deep learning with SHAP explainability.

Overview :
This project builds a predictive system for aviation safety by analyzing historical aircraft and flight data.  
It uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for classification and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain model decisions.

Tech Stack:
- Python, TensorFlow / Keras  
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- SHAP for explainability  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization  

Key Features:
- Predicts likelihood of aircraft failures or accidents  
- Explains each prediction using SHAP values  
- Visualizes important features influencing decisions  

Results:
- Achieved 98.2% accuracy

Dataset
- Aviation Maintenance Dataset from NGAFID – Kaggle
